## Folder Structure
There are bunch of top level lesson folders. Within each lesson folder, there are 2 subfolders. One subfolder is called `sandbox`, and gives template code (if need be) and is the place where you can write your code. The other subfolder is called `.solution`. It contains the solution along with a short explanation and what sort of takeaways there are.
